# Java Practice Projects

This is where Iâ€™m practising different **Java implementations, data structures, and algorithm challenges**.  

It includes:

- Mini coding challenges (like MoveZeroes, RemoveElement, ReverseArray, etc.)  
- ADT implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, ListNode)  

All code is written and tested by me as part of my learning and problem-solving practice.
